# Elevator System
## What our system allows?
The building's lift operation system allows:
  1.  Moving up to 16 lifts simultaneously in a building
  2.  Summoning a couple of lifts at the same time on demand
  3.  Reaching the customer quickly

## Before starting
  1.  Make sure you have Java installed
  2.  Make sure you have Gradle installed

## How to run it?

  1. `git clone https://github.com/arturgesiarz/Elevator_System.git`
  2. `cd Elevator_System`
  3. `./gradlew`
  4. `./gradlew run`

Once these commands have been executed, an infinite simulation of lift recalls will start. Infinite - because, the system must run continuously and contractually it will get further lift recall commands.

## In which it was written ?

The system was written in Java.
